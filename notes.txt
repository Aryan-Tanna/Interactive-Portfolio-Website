How the Light Rays Got Resolved
The Core Problem
The main issue was OGL (the WebGL library) wasn't loading properly in the browser, which prevented the light rays shader from rendering.

Why OGL Wasn't Loading
1. CDN Version Mismatch
Initially tried: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ogl@0.0.41/dist/ogl.min.js
Problem: This version doesn't have a pre-built browser bundle in the dist folder
Modern OGL versions (1.x) only ship ES module source files, not browser-ready UMD/IIFE bundles
2. Script Loading Order Issues
Used defer attribute on both OGL and background.js
Problem: With defer, scripts execute in order but asynchronously after DOM loads. Sometimes 
background.js
 ran before OGL's global was available
This caused: window.OGL is undefined
3. ES Module Import Issues
Downloaded ogl.js from esm.sh which was an ES module
Problem: ES modules use import/export syntax which doesn't work in regular <script> tags
Caused: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'
4. Local File Import Problems
The downloaded ES module tried to import dependencies from CDN URLs
Problem: Browser tried to resolve relative imports, leading to 404 errors like /ogl@0.0.94/es2022/ogl.mjs
The Final Solution
What Worked:
html
<script type="module">
  import { Renderer, Program, Triangle, Mesh } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/ogl';
  
  // All light rays code inline here...
</script>
Why This Worked:
Skypack CDN (cdn.skypack.dev)
Automatically converts npm packages to browser-compatible ES modules
Resolves all dependencies correctly
Works reliably without local files
Inline ES Module
<script type="module"> tells browser to treat code as ES module
Can use import statements directly
No separate file loading issues
Single Execution Context
Everything runs in one script block
No timing/order issues between files
OGL classes available immediately after import
Key Lessons
Modern libraries often don't ship browser bundles anymore (only ES modules for bundlers)
CDN choice matters: Skypack, esm.sh work for ES modules; jsDelivr/unpkg need specific versions with pre-built bundles
ES modules in browser: Use <script type="module"> and import from CDN URLs that support it
Inline code can be simpler than managing multiple file dependencies when CDN access is unreliable
The light rays now work because OGL loads correctly from Skypack CDN as an ES module, and all the shader/rendering code executes immediately after in the same module scope.
